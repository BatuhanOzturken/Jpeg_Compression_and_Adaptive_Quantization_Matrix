# Jpeg_Compression_and_Adaptive_Quantization_Matrix
Within the scope of digital signal processing project. We compressed an image with bitmap extension as Jpeg and obtained the compressed image again. We did this using both a fixed quantization matrix and an adaptive quantization matrix. Please review the report for detailed explanations.
